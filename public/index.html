                        Hi, I'm a software engineer from Atlanta, Georgia. I gradauted from Georgia State University

                        a new UI for an application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My next experience will be
                        as a Research & Development Software Engineer at Manhattan Associates starting this
