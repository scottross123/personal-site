I am not interested in harvesting your data, tracking you, or violating your privacy.

This site is hosted on a web server, so like when you make a request to any other web server, I can see your IP address and the time the request was made. From your IP address I or any other website you connect to can get your approximate geolocation. If you want keep this information private, I recommend using a tool such as a VPN, proxy, or Tor which will mask your true IP address and therefore your true location. There are many caveats using tools like these and technical details which I am not going to explain here, so if you are unfamiliar with these tools I recommend you do your research.

I collected minimal analytics through a self-hosted [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) instance, a privacy-respecting FOSS alternative to Google Analytics.

My reason for collecting these analytics is because I am curious how many people are visiting this site, where they are coming from, and what pages people find most interesting.

You can view the public analytics dashboard below. Any analytics I can see through the use of this software you can also see here.

If you prefer to just avoid all analytics whatsoever, the best way would be to just disable JavaScript on this site. JavaScript is not nor will it ever be required for this site to be functional. If you have [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) you can do this easily for sites of your choosing (I also recommend uBlock Origin generally for just making browsing web far more tolerable).
