I am not interested in harvesting your data or violating your privacy.

## Analytics

In future I want to collect privacy respecting analytics using a [Plausible](https://plausible.io/). I do not want to sell anything, I'm just curious about how many people are visiting my site, what countries, and what posts are being read. I don't have that setup yet though so right now I don't see or collect anything.

## JavaScript

The only JavaScript I will have on this site is probably a day/night theme picker and the Plausible script. This site will always be fully functional without enabling JavaScript

Nah just kidding. No cookies or tracking or any of that nonsense what so ever.
