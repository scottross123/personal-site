title = "Rustic Peasant Bread"
+++

This recipe is based off the recipe for Rustic Peasant Bread from the Southern Ground book. It interested me seeing cracked rye used in both the levain and in scald added to the bread, but I donâ€™t have any cracked rye so I substituted with pumpernickel rye meal. This is a really coarse grind of rye flour, somewhere between whole grain rye and cracked grain. It makes up about ~30% of the total flour in the recipe.

## Bakerâ€™s %s:

### Dough

- 100% CM ABC+ (white 11.5% bread flour)
- 80% water
- 71% scald
- 20% levain
- 2.2% salt

### Scald

- 100% rye meal
- 120% boiling or very hot water

Poured water over meal, mixed, then left overnight

### Levain

- 100% rye meal
- 100% water
- 20% starter
    

Matured for about 12 hours

### Method

! make these numbers

Made 1x1kg loaf

- The morning of, autolyse all the white flour and scald for one hour
- Add levain, mix, rest ~15 minutes, add salt, mix, waited another 5-10 minutes and mixed again.
    
- Bulked fermentation was around 4.5 hours keeping it around 75-78F. 4 folds at 30 minute intervals in the beginning. Volume increased ~50% or more, could have probably taken it out earlier but got distracted.
    
- Preshaped then bench rested for ~30 minutes.
    
- Proofed at cool ~70F room temperature for 2.5 hours. Maybe I could have gone longer, any thoughts? Iâ€™ve slowly been getting more brave with room temperature proofs, still a bit chicken though ðŸ˜….
    
- I put the dough in the freezer while preheating my oven to stop fermentation and make it easier to score.
    
- Baked at 460F for 45 minutes.
    

This bread is super soft inside, I love it! The rye scald adds a lot of extra moisture and softness without making the dough overly wet. The flavor is good, pretty mild from all the white flour at first but then you also get the sweetness from the rye scald and tang from the rye levain. I wish I added some wheat germ, this would have also better approximated the Carolina ground type 75 flour called for in the original recipe. Overall very happy!

Related question if anyone knows, is there difference between country bread / pain de campagne and peasant bread? I only call this a peasant bread instead of country bread because the original recipe is called rustic peasant bread. But Iâ€™m not sure if thereâ€™s any real convention other than what the baker wants to call their bread.
