# Country Bread w/ Spelt Levain and Toasted Corn Flour

70% CM ABC+ (medium strong white flour)

~10% whole grain spelt (all in levain)

10% sprouted whole wheat

10% toasted corn flour (toasted fine cornflour in a skillet until browned and aromatic)

80% water

2% salt

10% PFF, all spelt

Made one small 650g loaf

For the levain, 1:2:2 starter:spelt:water and matured for 5 hours at warm temps. Autolyse the rest of the flour for 2 hours. Bulk fermentation was ~4 hours at 78-80F, 4 coil folds at 15 minute intervals, then two more coil folds at 1 hour intervals. Preshaped pretty tightly and bench rested for ~30 minutes, then shaped and proofed for 10 minutes, and into a cold fridge overnight. Baked in a lodge cast iron combo cooker at 460F for 40 minutes, first 20 minutes with lid on.

A bit more white flour then I’ve recently been baking with but didn’t find it bland tasting at all, a bit tangy too. Wanted to go back to something more basic after doing lots of porridge, enriched ,and whole grain sourdoughs. Pretty happy with it, love how the ear opened up!
