title = "Spelt Focaccia"
+++

Mostly used theperfectloaf/Maurizioâ€™s recipe here as reference, very good starting point for focaccia imo!

50% whole grain spelt

50% CM ABC+ (white bread flour)

85% water

3% extra virgin olive oil

2% salt

7% pff, ~15% young levain

Autolyse for 1 hour, reserved about ~10% of the total water. Added levain, mix, wait 15 minutes, add salt, oil, and reserved water. 2 folds at 15 minute intervals, then 4 more folds at 30 minute. Bulk proofed for ~4 hours total at 76-78F, then dumped into a VERY well oiled 9x13 pan. Proofed at room temperature for 1 hour, spreading out dough to the edge of the pan at 30 minutes. Into the fridge overnight. The next day, I took it and let it proof at room temp for ~3 hours, or until it nearly tripled in size. Dimpled and topped with fresh rosemary, sea salt, and more extra virgin olive oil. Baked at 475F for 30 minutes.

Mostly good but I think I messed up the salt measurement, too much sea salt on top and not enough salt in the dough. Love the flavor of spelt though, and the crumb is really soft.
