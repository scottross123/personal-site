First sourdough baguettes in months now! Definitely plan to bake more. Visually, could be better. I obviously need practice on scoring and I think kinda screwed up the baking temp, tried to increase the baking temperature for the last 5 or so minutes but ended up burning the tops a little and getting an uneven color. Shaping also needs practice. Based my recipe mostly on Hamelman's for sourdough baguettes in Bread and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiqEhzyc7zQ) video from King Arthur featuring Martin Philip.

Baker's %s:

85% CM ABC+ (malted white flour, 11.5%)

10% whole grain khorasan

5% toasted wheat germ

76% water (originally 75%, but added an extra percent while mixing cause the dough felt a bit too stiff. Could likely increase hydration further)

2% salt

.1% malt powder

15% PPF made into overnight white levain

made 3 x 300g baguettes

Autolyse with starter for 30 minutes, bulk for 2.5 hours with two coil folds at 50 minutes (looked for 30% rise, but maybe could have gone on further) at 75-78F, preshape into cylinders and rest for 40 minutes, shape into ~13-14 inch baguettes (see video). Proofed for 1.5 hours at cool room temp and firmed up in the fridge for 20. Bake at 460F for minutes (tried to turn up to 500F for color for last five minutes, next might just bake at a higher temp).

Normally I like to bake with a lot more whole grain than this, but the flavor on this was still pretty good! Little acidity for a sourdough baguette. Love the added nuttiness from the toasted germ. Very happy with the soft, almost tender texture, not overly chewy at all. The crust was pretty thin, pleased with that. Definitely gonna try more baguettes, with more whole grain next time.

Also, had a kinda weird thing happen where the baguettes curved upward while baking, anyone know what could be the cause of this?
