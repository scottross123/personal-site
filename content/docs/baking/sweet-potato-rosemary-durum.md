50% sweet potato

2.5% salt

~1% fresh rosemary

7% of the total flour prefermented

In the morning I made a young white levain and autolysed the flour for ~3-4 hours. Dough was a bit stiffer than I normally like but I assumed the potato would had lots of extra moisture, which it did, so this was fine. After autolysed, add levain, wait 20 minutes, add all other ingredients including potato and mix.

The sweet potato seems to speed up fermentation. Bulk proof probably could have been ended under four hours, but I needed to leave for a while and had to put my dough in the fridge. Total bulk proof time was over 5 hours because of that, a little over 50% increase in volume. 4 coil folds at 30 minute intervals for the first 2 hours.

Bench rest for 30 minutes are preshaping, then almost immediately into the fridge after shaping. Baked this morning at 460F for ~50 minutes.

While I’m mostly happy, there were some mishaps. Firstly, slightly overproofed. The dough felt very proofy after I ended bulk. Even though I put it into the fridge almost immediately after shaping, my fridge is being a bit weird and some areas get a lot cooler than others. I accidentally left the dough in a warmer spot so it continued to proof more than I would have liked in the fridge. As a result, the loaf is a bit flatter, and didn’t get any nice ears. I also screwed up scoring a bit trying to do a double cut. And shaping, I made a large loaf (1.2kg) and it was a little more difficult for me to shape.

What I am happy about is the taste and texture. I practically inhaled the first two slices of this! I love the flavor of the sweet potato and durum! The potato also adds incredible softness and moistness to the crumb! Try adding potato to your bread, I will definitely be making more potato breads.

And for the sweet potato I just roasted ~2x the weight I used in the dough in a 425F oven until tender. After roasting came out to be a bit over half what I needed, then just ate the leftovers.
