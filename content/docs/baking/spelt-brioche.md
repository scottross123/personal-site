Naturally leavened bricohe, take two! Changed up the recipe from my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/nr1y9b/100_naturally_leavened_and_partially_whole_grain/) on this bread, with more enrichment and 50% whole grain spelt! Took a risk and decided to base off the recipe for brioche from Hamelman's Bread, which I've made multiple times with just instant yeast. It's basically the same as the KA professional formula [here](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/pro/formulas/brioche). I used half white wheat half whole grain spelt, prefermented 20% of the white flour into a stiff sweet starter (100% flour, 50% liquid starter, 37.5% water, 20% sugar), and replaced most of the sugar with honey. Whole grains of course absorb more water, so I ended up nearly doubling the amount of water to get the right consistency! Super impressed with how this came out!

Baker's %s:

50% CM ABC+

50% CM Whole Grain Spelt

50% butter

50% egg

~18% water (started with ~10%)

10% raw honey

3.5% sugar (in sweet starter)

2.5% salt

Zest of one orange

Had to adapt a bit during the mix stage. First I mixed everything with the paddle together except the honey and butter, but the dough was waaay too stiff. So just added all the honey but still a little too stiff. Let it rest for ~20 minutes, come back, added water until i got the right consistency. Let rest again for a little bit, then still with the paddle on speed 2, knead until gluten is moderately developed, and begin adding [butter](https://imgur.com/YE25iz6). Once all the butter is added the dough should have a very strong windowpane. [After mixing.](https://imgur.com/3oCUP8h)

One of my concerns when using spelt is its fragile gluten compared to modern wheat. I was afraid the intensive kneading required for brioche would shred it to pieces, but amazingly enough, a very strong dough came out of mixing with a very good [windowpane test](https://imgur.com/CX6uvqK)!

I did after 3 folds in 15-minute intervals to make sure the dough stayed strong (spelt tends to spread), but that might have been unnecessary. Bulk was ~5.5 hours at ~75-78F in which in went ~50% increase volume. Could have probably pulled it sooner but I lost track of time, then I let it chill in a very cold fridge overnight.

Next morning I divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, to make a bricohe nanterre in a 9x4x4 pullman pan. Proofed for 3.5 hours at warm temperatures. Egg washed with yolk and milk, baked at 450F for 15 minutes then 400F for 25 more minutes.

A common issue when baking brioche and other soft doughs especially in tall tins like a pullman is sinking sides while cooling. I found a tip on a different forum which i tried for this bake: leave the loaf to cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then take it out and leave it in the cooling oven for another 10-15 minutes on the rack to firm up the sides. No sinking sides! Try not to leave it in the oven too long though or you risk thickening the crust too much. Glazed with raw honey afterward.

The texture of this thing was incredible. Despite all the whole grain, very [shreddable](https://imgur.com/x9vbo2Y) and [soft](https://imgur.com/fi2DJBu). Like biting into a buttery cloud. The raw honey, nutty spelt, and butter together tasted amazing. I was worried about how the flavor would turn out with the starter + whole grains, but really impressed. Personally I tasted no sourness at all, my mother however did complain (she hates ALL things sourdough though so not really concerned). Really happy with how this turned out.

The [bottom](https://imgur.com/eVia4Th) of the loaf looks really ugly though, I think because of how I placed the balls in the pullman tin, it was a little difficult. You can also see indentations from the oven rack, should have used a baking sheet. Overall a success though and plan to do more variations on this dough!
