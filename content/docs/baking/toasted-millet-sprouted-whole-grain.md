title = "Toasted Millet and Sprouted Whole Grain"
+++

Based of toasted millet porridge from Tartine No. 3

1/3 CM ABC+ (malted white flour)

1/3 CM T85 (high extraction flour)

1/3 Sprouted whole grain wheat flour

76% water

15% toasted millet (later toasted into porridge, all of porridge added to dough

2.5% salt

7% PFF, or ~15% levain (keep in mind the %s are different if you include the levain as an ingredient)

Autolyse and mature young levain for 3 hours, add levain and mix, wait 30 minutes, add salt and millet, mix.

Bulk proofed for 5 hours, with 6 folds at 30 minute intervals in the beginning. Dough came to about 50% increase in volume.

Preshaped and bench rest for 30 minutes, shaped as boule then immediately into a cold fridge

Baked at 460F for 50 minutes

Very happy with this, porridge gives it a soft and custardy crumb. Flavor is great, slightly tangy. Wanted to make a boule cause I normally make batards, but I kinda screwed up the diamond pattern. Need more practice with scoring!


To prepare the millet porridge, toast the millet in oven at 350F for ~20 or until browned slightly and aromatic, soak in ~3x weight in water overnight. Tomorrow morning, bring to a boil in soaking liquid, then simmer until the millet has absorbed all the liquid. Cool, then add all of the porridge to dough along with salt.
