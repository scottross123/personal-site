title = "Old Bread Porridge and Flaxseed Sourdough"
+++

The idea for this came to me after reading Katz’s The Art of Fermentation and Tartine No. 3. Katz’s book has a brief mention of old bread porridge, where simply stale bread is soaked for a while then cooked into a thick porridge, and Tartine has a large section on different porridge breads and the methodology for that. So inspired from that I took some old sourdough and old volkonbrot, soaked that for a couple hours then cooked on the stove until I got a thick porridge. That on its own tasted a bit weird like watery toast, but I was hoping it would add a lot extra moisture to get that custardy crumb.

15% Whole Grain Rye

15% Sprouted Whole Wheat

35% Central Milling T85

17.5% KA BF

17.5% KA Lancelot (added for extra strength I thought it might need)

75% water (not including water from porridge!)

50% old bread porridge

5% toasted flaxseeds

2.5% salt

7% of the flour was preferment which I used in my levain, that being half rye half white.

Autolyse for ~2 hours, add levain and rest for 30 minutes, add salt and porridge then start bulk proof. 4 folds every 30 minutes and total bulk for ~4 hours at ~78F, fast moving ferment because of the sprouted wheat and rye. Bench rest for 30 minutes, proof at cool room temp for 15 minutes, then overnight in a very cold fridge. Baked in the morning at 460F with steam for 50 minutes.

Texture of the crumb was amazing, almost melt in your mouth custardy. Wish I added some more flaxseeds and got a more even distribution. Tasted pretty wheaty slightly sour, nutty from the flaxseeds, enjoyed it a lot!
