More sourdough baguettes, based on Hamelman's recipe in Bread again. This time with whole grain spelt!

Baker's %s:

70% CM ABC+ (malted white flour, 11.5%)

30% whole grain spelt

75% water

2% salt

.1% malt powder

15% PPF

made 3 x 350g baguettes

Make young levain in the morning, mature for 3 hours. 3 hour autolyse at cool room temp. Bulk and 72-73F for 1.5 hours, coil folds every 30 minutes, then overnight in the fridge. By tomorrow morning the dough rose by ~50% in volume. Left just under an hour at room tempature to warm up dough, then preshaped into cylinders and bench rested for 30 minutes. Shaped into 13-14inch baguettes and proofed at cool room temperature for 1.5 hours. Chilled in fridge for 20 minutes. Baked at 470F 15 minutes with steam, vent, approximately 10-12 more minutes. At this point I was afraid I underbaked it a little so I let them cool in the turned off oven for another 30 or so minutes.

Improvment on my [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/nxreg2/first_baguettes_a_in_while/) baguette bake I think. I tried to do 4 cuts on a couple of them but I sort of screwed that up, but the 3 cut one came out very nice I think. Also these are a bit dark. Last time I baked at 460F and had problems with browning, so I tried 470F but this batch seemed to brown much faster. Prehaps due to the cold overnight fermentation? I get these aren't the traditional baguette color and probably considered burnt by most, but not gonna lie I kinda like them this dark. Will try and go lighter next time though.

The spelt adds a ton of extensibility, felt great to work with this dough!

Taste was great, very little acidity. I was afraid the cold fermentation would add more sour flavour but I was pleasantly surprised, I want to try and keep sourness to a minimum with baguettes. Very happy with crumb and texture! Very soft inside! Definitely gonna bake more of these.
