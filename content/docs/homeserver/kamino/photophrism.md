[PhotoPrism](https://www.photoprism.app/) is a self-hosted photo manager I'm looking into to possible replace Nextcloud Photos. I've also used [Immich](https://immich.app/) is the past which is a very cool project but decided against using it long term just because it is still in heavy development. I will update this page when I begin working on this.
