This is my old Macbook with a barely usable keyboard and 30 minute battery life I have repurpose as a backup and BlueBubbles server. [BlueBubbles](https://docs.bluebubbles.app/landing-page/) is an open-source application that allows you send and recieve iMessages on non-Apple devices. There are clients for Android, Linux, Windows, and the web, but the web client is not self-hostable. I use this to get iMessage on my ThinkPads which run Linux.

For backups I use [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). BorgBackup is a deduplicating backup programming that supports encryption. My Macbook acts as a remote Borg repository I backup my server and laptop to over SSH.
