# 100% Whole Grain Sourdough

[original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/o6nv9k/100_whole_grain_sourdough/)

95% KA white whole wheat

5% whole rye

95% water

2.2% salt

5% prefermented flour

Night before I made a premix with all the flour, salt, and 90% of the water. I followed the instructions [here](http://www.breadwerx.com/how-to-mix-perfect-supple-sourdough-without-kneading/) to make the premix. I also made a whole wheat 60% hydration levain the night before with 5% of the flour.

Next day, I had some issues with bulk. I donâ€™t think the levain matured long enough cause my kitchen was too cold, so bulk took like 6 hours at 78-80F. I gave coils at 30 min intervals till I could see it finally grain some volume. Preshaped tightly for 30 minutes, shaped, proof two hours at room temperature, bake at 460F for 45 minutes.

Inside is nice and moist, taste is very wheaty and tangy, great accompaniment to meal!
