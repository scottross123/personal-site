No worries! In professional baking yes, percentages will always be used. I'm an amateur but still swear by it. It's accurate, makes scaling recipes up and down very easy, and very useful for modifying and adjusting ingredients.

How it works is every ingredient is listed as % based on its ratio to the total amount of flour. So the flour will always add up to 100%. So as example, if a recipe is listed as

- 100% flour
- 70% water
- 2% salt

That means the water is 70% the weight of the flour and the salt is 2%. So if you had 500g of flour, you need 500 * .7 = 350g of water and 500 * .02 = 10g of salt.

You can use baker's %s to find out the amount of flour you need for any quantity of dough by adding up all the %s to get your total percentage. So for the example recipe, that would be 100% + 70% + 2% = 172%. Say you want a 2 lb (908g) loaf. Divide by the total percentage, so 908 / 1.72, to get the flour you need, 528g. So using 528g flour and the correct weights for your other ingredients will get you 2 lbs of dough, (528g flour + 528 * .7 = 370g water + 528 * .02 = 10.5g salt) = ~908g dough.

Using my recipe, I wanted 3kg of dough for three 1kg loaves, so I divided 3000g by 2.06 (total percentage 206%) to get 1456g in total flour weight.

There's also prefermented flour or PFF. Usually I prefer to do as Hamelman does in his book and take a portion of the flour to preferment with my starter, then list that as the PFF %. But I think most people here treat the starter as a separate ingredient, e.g. 100% flour 70% water 20% starter 2% salt. I prefer the former because you get the true ratio of ingredients and it just makes more sense to me, especially in recipes with more ingredients beyond just flour/water/salt.

I hope this was helpful and not just an information overload. Sorry I kinda got carried away ðŸ˜…. If you need me to condense or better explain something you can ask!

Edit: Thank you! Can confirm they were delicious :)
