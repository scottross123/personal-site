Country Rye Sourdough w/ maple syrup, beer, and butter toasted rye flake porridge!

40% CM T85

20% KA BF

20% KA Sir Lancelot

20% Whole grain rye

75% hydration (30% beer and 45% water)

50% rye flake porridge (rye flakes toasted in a couple tablespoons of butter then cooked into porridge. Used mostly water for liquid and some leftover beer)

7% maple syrup

2.5% salt

7% flour prefermented

Young white levain made in the morning and matured for 3 hours at warm temperatures, dough autolysed for same amount of time. While dough is autolysing, I made the porridge with 1:2 flakes:liquid after toasting the flakes in some butter. Add levain, rest ~15 minutes, add salt and maple syrup, rest ~15 minutes, finally add in porridge and begin bulk proof after mix.

I gave this dough 8 coil folds after 30 minute intervals for the first 4 hours. This was a very wet and sticky dough after adding the porridge so I wanted to make sure the dough was strong and retained some tension through bulk, hence the amount of folding. After that I bulk took ~40-60 minutes longer. Divided, preshaped, bench rest for 40 minutes. After shaping let it rest at cool room temp for 10 minutes and then into fridge overnight.

Noticed something weird about my fridge, one of the loaves got much colder and therefore proofed less than the other. The more proofed one was a little more horizontal but both were fine in the end! Need to figure whatâ€™s up with my fridge though.

Baked at 460F for 45 minutes. Thought the maple syrup would encourage browning too fast but it actually turned out good, left at 460F for the whole bake.

The aroma and taste of these loaves is amazing! The beer and maple give this an amazing smell. A little sweet from the maple syrup, and had a great cereal taste. Soft almost tender texture, I love the texture and added moisture in porridge breads. Very pleased overall!
