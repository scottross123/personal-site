Cold seed starter straight from the fridge

# Process
---

1. Autolyse for an hour
2. Went up to probably like ~90% hydration or more in mixing
3. durr

# Notes
---
- I fucked up the shaping via stitching because I was too slow. Came out a bit flat but still good
- Did not use ice cubes for steaming, just how I normally do it with boiling water and turning off the oven
