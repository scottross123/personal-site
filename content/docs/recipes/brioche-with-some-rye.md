## Method

1. Mix preferment with warm water and let rest for ~12 hours at 70 degrees.
2. Mix all ingredients except butter in stand mixer at speed 2 for 2-4min, add water if necessary to get a medium consistency (I had to add somw water)
3. Mix on speed 3 for 3 minutes.
4.  Beat butter with a rolling pin under parchment paper until it reaches a pliable consistency (like if you were making a croissant).
5. Reduce to speed 2, switch to paddle attachment and begin adding butter bit by bit, waiting for butter to be fully incoporated before adding more. This step can take to 10 minutes.
6. Increase to speed 3 a mix until dough is cohesive and strong. Dough should have a clean window pane test.
7. Transfer to bulk femrent container and bulk ferment for 1-2 hours until puffy.
8. Fold dough to degass and transfer container to fridge overnight.
9. The next morning, transfer container to countertop and allow to rest for ~30 min (but not for too long or it may be too difficult to shape).
10. Divide dough into 28 x 62.5g piecs, and 8 x 93.75 pieces.
11. Shape pieces into balls.
12. Place 16 62.5g pieces into two 8.5x2.75x3.5 containers and 12 pieces into one 10x4x3 container
13. Allow to proof for 1-2 hours at 80F until the douh has reached the the top of the pan and is puffy.
14. Egg wash then bake at 350F for 30 minutes.
