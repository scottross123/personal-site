# Normandy Apple Bread

[original recipe](https://old.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/prykoq/normandy_apple_bread_made_with_cider_and_dried/)

Based this on the Normandy apple bread from Jeffrey Hamelman's Bread. I increased the hydration, changed the flour, and omitted the fresh yeast in the original recipe.

**Baker's %s:**

- 18% PFF
    
- 36.5% CM ABC+ (11.5% white flour)
    
- 36.5% CM T85 (12.5% high extraction flour)
    
- 18% whole grain spelt (all prefermented)
    
- 9% whole grain rye
    
- 42% unfiltered apple cider
    
- 42% water
    
- 15% dried apples
    
- 5% raw wheat germ
    
- 2% salt
    

_Preferment_

- 100% whole grain spelt
    
- ~56% water (Total hydration is 60%)
    
- 20% liquid starter
    

**Process**

Fermented preferment for 12 hours at 70F

Autolyse flours, wheat germ, and 90% of the liquid for 3 hours

Because I was making such a large quantity of dough (3kg), I opted to use my stand mixer. Added salt and starter then mixed gently on speed 2 (while incorporating the reserved water) until gluten was moderately developed. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then put on speed 1 and gradually incorporated dried apples.

Bulk fermentation was about 3 hours at 70F, until 30-50% increased in size. Gave four folds at 30 minute intervals for the first 2 hours.

Preshaped and let bench rest for ~40 minutes.

Shaped via stitching, proofed at cool room temp for 15 minutes, then into a very cold fridge overnight.

Next morning the dough still felt underproofed to me, so I left it out at room temperature to proof for another 2 hours.

Baked at 440F on a baking steel with steam. Baked at a lower temperature as to prevent the bread from browning too quickly due to the sugar in the apple cider.

**Notes**

Probably one of my favorite breads in a long time. Tastes sweet, tangy and applely. Amazing smell. Would definitely make again. Next time I would probably increase the hydration further. 84% is pretty high but wheat germ absorbs a lot of water, so the dough actually didn't feel wet at all and had a nice consistency. Could have also proofed longer I felt, maybe would have gotten more volume. Overall very pleased with this!

For the dried apples I just cut 8 apples into chunks and baked them at 250F for a couple hours until leathery. After that I cut them into smaller chunks before adding to the dough.

Here, let me go a bit more depth what I did with the apples:

I cut about 7-8 large honeycrisp apples into rough chunks, leaving them in a lemon juice water while cutting so they didn't brown. Then I put them all on two parchment lined baking sheets and baked at 250F, rotating and tossing every hour, until dried and leathery, I think about 3-4 hours (but I feel I probably should have taken them out earlier, some were too dry and tough).

Before adding to the dough, I chopped them up a bit more finely. Then set my kitchenaid to speed 1 and gradually added the apples, mixing just until evenly incorporate. No puree or mash.

Mix-ins like dried fruits and nuts can interfere with gluten formation so its much preferable and easier to add them after gluten as been developed. It's common to add them in after mix with a stretch and fold or lamination fold (my preference). However, because I was doing such a large batch of dough, and using my mixer already, it made more sense to mix the apples in gently on the lowest speed.

I've done bread with potato, pumpkin, and plantain so I can give some guidance on that. You want to mash them well so they homogenize into the dough. I've had some issues where I didn't mash properly or cooked them long enough and ended up with chunks of potato and plantain in my dough. Not the end of the world though. If you're using canned pumpkin puree that shouldn't be an issue. I've only used the canned stuff but will definitely try actual pumpkin or squash this fall!

But like mix-ins and fat, these ingredients prevent gluten formation, so you want to add them after you've already moderately developed your gluten. If I were making pumpkin bread in similar fashion to this I would do it in the same way, mix gently in on speed 1 after gluten has been developed. By hand I would give the dough one round of mixing by hand with the levain, let it rest, then give it another round of mixing adding the pumpkin.

Edit: If pumpkin puree is a significant portion hydration it should be added in the beginning with the other liquid, pumpkin puree has a lot of moisture.

And thank you! You will as long as you keep baking and practice :)
