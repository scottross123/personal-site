First time baking with sprouted/malted (believe it means the same thing, correct me if I’m wrong) berries. I followed the instructions in Tartine No. 3 to sprout some rye berries which I included in the dough. I thought the malt flavors of beer and barley malt syrup might complement it well, but I think I added too much syrup it was a bit overpowering and caused the loafs to brown too fast.

30% KA BF

30% CM T85

20% Whole Grain Rye

10% KA White WW

10% CM Whole Grain Spelt

55% Water

30% Beer (one Stella lager)

25% Sprouted Rye Berries

7% Barley Malt Syrup (too much! Would change to 3-4% if I could do it again)

2.5% Salt

7% PFF, made into young levain with white flour the morning of.

Autolyse for 2 hours, add levain, wait 20 minutes, and salt and malt syrup, then bulk proof. Stretch and fold after 30, laminate and add sprouted berries after another 30, 4 coil folds all spaced by 40 minutes. Bulk proof took a total of ~5 hours at 78-80F. Divide into two 1.2kg loaves, bench rest for 20 minutes, shape and proof at cool room temp for 30 minutes, then overnight in very cold fridge. Baked at 460F for 20 minutes w/ steam then realized it was getting way too dark too fast (was already black in places!) so I dropped the oven temp to 400F for another ~30 minutes.

Loving the texture of high hydration loaves! That was a definite winner. Again too much malt syrup it was kinda overpowering, would’ve liked to taste the beer more. In my defense I don’t use it much outside of bagels so wasn’t sure how much to use haha. A little tangy but not much.
