## Technology Related

This is a pretty big list. To be honset I probably won't get to most of it this year but hopefully a couple.

### A Functional Programming Language (Clojure)

I want to learn an FP language to challenege myself and expand general programming knowledge by learning a new paradigm. Clojure interests me the most. Also might a look a little in Haskell but right now I'm leaning heavily towards Clojure. Runs on the JVM and JS ecosystem which is where I've definitely programmed the most, and something about Lisp really draws in me. Maybe it's all those (( parantheses )). Would also like to have a look at Common Lisp, but I think Clojure makes the most sense for me to learn since I want a purely functional language and it operates on the JVM. 

### System Level Programming

I would like to learn a bit more about lower level programming langauges for a similar reason as to learning an FP language, but also to learn more about how programming works under the hood. I was making an effort to learn Rust but lost interest just because I didn't really have use case for it. But it is a super cool langauge that I want to pick up sometime in the future. I would like to learn some C too, I have Brian Kernighan's legendary *The C Programming Language* on my bookshelf.

### Game Development

I have always been interseted in game development. I feel like a lot of people's first interst in programming starts off with wanting to know how their favorite games are made, or at least that's where I started off. Either that or their interest in making a shit load of money. 

To be honest from what I've read the professional game industry sounds awful, so I want to stay far away from that. But making an indie game for fun is definitely on my todo. Not sure If I'll get to it this year though.

I also wanted to try to make a Minecraft Forge mod in either Java or Kotlin (probably Kotlin unless the support for it is bad). But I have no idea when I'll get to that.

### Self-Hosting

I want to setup a home server and begin self hosting more services. Stuff for streaming, photos, files, git server, PiHole, and etc. The purpose being for better privacy and control. I can be a control freak when it comes to my hobbies and interests so I've really been wanting to get into this stuff.

### Hardware / PC Building

I definitely want to build a PC this year. Ideally I would like to try out Linux on it and see how I like it as my daily driver as well as Windows for games. Learning a bit about computer hardware would also be nice.

### Prviacy and Security

I want to learn more about and take my internet privacy and security more seriously this year. Rely less on Google and other big tech companies. Hopefully make it a bit harder for them to make money off just existence.
