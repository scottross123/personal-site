I'm a software engineer from Atlanta, Georgia. I graduated from Georgia State University
with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2022. My primary interest and experience is web development.
My most recent experience was as a Software Engineer Intern at HealthEdge, where I worked on
a new UI for an application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My next experience will be
as a Research & Development Software Engineer at Manhattan Associates starting next year.
