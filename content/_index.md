I'm a software engineer from Atlanta, Georgia. I graduated from Georgia State University
with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2022. My primary interest and experience is web development.
My most recent experience was as a Software Engineer Intern at <u>[HealthEdge](https://healthedge.com/)</u>, where I worked on
a new UI for an application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I will be starting as an R&D Software
Engineer at <u>[Manhattan Associates](https://www.manh.com/)</u> this upcoming January.
